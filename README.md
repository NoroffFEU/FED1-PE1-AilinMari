## Description
I have made a sweet baking blog using the API endpoints we got provided from Noroff. Creating Log in, log out, delete posts, create posts, create account and fetch posts to show them in a thumbnailgrid on the frontpage. You can also click on each blogpost to go to each blogpost and read them. I have also created a picture carousel on the top of the blog that display the last 3 blogposts with picture and name. This blog is so sweet you will get a sugar rush! I have made the functiuons using JavaScript that was a big part of the assignment.
