## Description
RainyDays is rainjacket company selling rainjackets for bot male and female. I wanted to create a clean design where it was easy to know where to click next. You are able to look at the products in a thumbnailgrid on the frontpage, and also go to a detailed page about each product. You can add and remove products from your shoopping cart. And you can also filter the different products (male, female on sale or not).
